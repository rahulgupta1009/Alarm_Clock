# Alarm_Clock
The objective of our project is to implement an
alarm clock using Python.
Inthis we have used some very innovative libraries
such as datetime and tkinter which help us to build
the project using the current date and time as well
as to provide a user interface to set the alarm
according to the requirement in 24-hour format.
